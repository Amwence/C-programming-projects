    - one variable to store with width
    - one variable to store height
    - one variable to store the perimiter
    - one variable to store the area

- The program should perform the calculation of the permiter of a rectangle
    - use the + and * operators
    - perimiter is height plus width times 2
    - area is multiplying width and height

- The program should display the height, width, and perimiter in the correct format in one print statement
