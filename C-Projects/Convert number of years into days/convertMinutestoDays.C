                            Note:
    The modulus operator only works with two integers so it will not
    work with the double type for years and days. In order to use the modulous 
    operator with double you have to typecast. Converting one datatype into
    another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example,
    if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type
    cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another 
    explicitly using the cast operator as follows âˆ’

(type_name) expression
