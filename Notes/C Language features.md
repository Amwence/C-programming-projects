# Main feautures of C:
1. Efficient
2. Portable
3. Powerful and Flexible
4. Programmer Oriented

# There are four Fundamental tasks in creation of any C program

1. Editing
    - The process of creating and modifying your C source code
    - Choose a wise name for your base file name (all source files end in the .c extension)
    - Source code is inside a file and contains the program instructions you write

2. Compiling
    - Converts your source code into machine language and detects and reports errors in your code
    - The input to the compiler is the file you produce during your editing (source file)
    - Compilation is a two-stage process: 
        - The first Stage is called the preprocessing phase, during which your code may be modified or added to 
        - the second stage is the actual compilation that generates the object code. 

    - The compiler examines each program statement and checks it to ensure that it conforms to the syntax and semantics of the language
    - Can also recognize structural errors (dead code)
    - does not find logic errors
    - typical errors reported might be due to an expression that has unbalanced parentheses (syntax error), or due to the use of a variable that is not "defined" (semantic error)
    - after all errors are fixed, the compiler will then take each statement of the program and translate it into assembly language
    - the compiler will then translate the assembly language statements into actual machine instructions
        - the output from teh compiler is known as object code and it is stored in files called object files (same name as source file with a .obj or .o extension)
    - The standard command to compile your C programs will be cc (or the GNU compiler, which is.gcc)
        - cc -c myprog.c or gcc -c myprog.c
        - if you omit the -c flag, your program will automatically be linked as well


3. Linking
    - After the program has been translated into object code, it is ready to be linked
        - The purpose of linking phase is to get the program into a final form for execution on the computer
        - Linking usually occurs automatically when compiling depending on what system you are on, but, can sometimes be a separate command. (getting all the dependancies in place and building an executable file, links all the .o files into an executable)
    - The linker combines the object modules generated by the compiler with additional libraries needed by the program to create the whole executable
        - Also detects and reports errors
        - if part of your program is missing or a nonexistant library component is referenced
    - Program libraries support and extend the C language by providing routines to carry out operations that are not part of the language
        - input and output libraries, mathematical libraries, string manipulation libraries (same as packages in other languages)
    - A failure during the linking phase means that once again you have to go back and edit your source code
    - Success will produce an executable file
        - In a Windows environment, the executable file will have an .exe extension
        - in UNIX/Linux, there will be no such extension (a.out by default)
        - Many IDEs have a build option, which will compile and link your program in a single operation to produce the executeable
    - A program of any significant size will consist of several source code files 
        - each source code file needs the compiler to generate the object file that need to be linked 
    - The program is much easier to manage by breaking it up into a number of smaller source files
        - It is cohesive and makes the development and maintenance of the program a lot easier
        - The set of source files that make up the program will usually be integrated under a project name, which is used to refer to the whole program


4. Executing
    - In most IDEs, you'll find an appropriate menu command that allows you to run or execute your compiled program
        - Otherwise double click the exe file or type a.out on the console in linux manually
    - The execution stage is where you run your program
        - each of the statements of the program is sequentially executed in turn
        - If the program requests any data from the user the program temporarily suspends its execution so t6hat the input can be entered
        - Results that are displayed by the program (output) appears in a window called console

    - This stage can produce a wide variety of error conditions
        - producing the wrong output
        - just sitting there and doing nothing
        - crashing your computer

    - If the program does not perform the intedned functionality then it will be necessary to go back and reanalyze the program's logic
        - Known as the debugging phase, correct all known problems or bugs from the program
        - Will need to make changes to the original source program
        - The entire process of compiling, linking, and executing the program must be repeated until the desired results are obtained
